## Welcome to my collection of desktop GUI applications! 

- These projects, while not large in scale, are both functional and visually appealing. 
- They were developed as final self-made projects during my journey through the
 "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course.  
- Each project showcases different aspects of graphical user interface design and implementation in Python.

 
## Project Details
- **Purpose**: To create functional and aesthetically pleasing desktop applications.
- **Development Time**: Each application was typically completed within 1-2 days.
- **Technologies Used**: Primarily Python with GUI libraries such as tkinter, PIL.
